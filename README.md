# **Bank Project (OOP)**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project simulates a basic banking system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It requires users to log in with a valid username and password, and after successful login, they will have access to a **Main Menu** with various banking operations. If the user fails to enter correct credentials within three attempts, the program locks, ensuring security.  

The application also implements **permissions using bitwise AND**, which controls access to certain menu options. Users' permissions are managed based on their roles, and only those with the appropriate permissions can access certain functionalities.

## **Features**  

### **Login System**  
- The system requires the user to input their **username** and **password**.
- If the user enters the wrong credentials three times, the program locks for security purposes.
- After successful login, the **login time** and **user details** are registered.
- The **Main Menu** is then displayed with various options.

### **Permissions (Bitwise AND)**  
- Permissions for each user are controlled using bitwise AND operations.  
- Each menu option has a permission flag, and only users with the appropriate permission level can access certain actions.  
- Permissions are checked before allowing access to specific features, such as adding new clients or transferring funds.  

### **Main Menu**  
The Main Menu includes the following **10 options**:

1. **Client Screen**  
   - Displays information about clients in the system.
  
2. **Add New Client**  
   - Allows users to add new clients by entering their details (e.g., name, account number, balance).

3. **Delete Client**  
   - Allows users to delete a client from the system.

4. **Update Client Info**  
   - Users can update information of an existing client (e.g., change balance, contact info).

5. **Find Client**  
   - Search for a client by their ID or name.

6. **Transactions**  
   - This screen includes the following **subscreens**:  
     - **Deposit**: Add funds to a client's account.  
     - **Withdraw**: Remove funds from a client's account.  
     - **Total Balances**: View the total balance of a client.  
     - **Transfer**: Transfer funds between clients.  
     - **Transfer Log**: View the history of transfers.

7. **Manage Users**  
   - This menu includes the following **subscreens**:  
     - **List Users**: Display all registered users.  
     - **Add New User**: Add a new user to the system.  
     - **Delete User**: Remove a user from the system.  
     - **Update User Info**: Edit the details of a user.  
     - **Find User**: Search for a user by their ID or username.

8. **Login Register**  
   - Users can register new usernames and passwords or edit existing ones.

9. **Currency Exchange**  
   - This screen includes the following **subscreens**:  
     - **List Currencies**: View all available currencies.  
     - **Find Currency**: Search for a specific currency.  
     - **Update Rate**: Change the exchange rate for a specific currency.  
     - **Currency Calculator**: Calculate currency conversion between different currencies.

10. **Logout**  
    - Returns the user to the login screen.

### **Submenu Functionality**  
- In any of the submenus mentioned above, users will also have the option to **return to the main menu** at any point.

---

## **Libraries Used**  

- **String Library**:  
  A custom string library is included, which offers various string manipulation functions for tasks like validation and formatting.
  
- **Validate Library**:  
  A library for input validation is used to ensure the integrity of data entered by users, such as verifying if a number is positive or if input meets certain criteria.

## **How to Use**  

1. **Start the Application**:  
   Run the executable file to launch the bank system.

2. **Login**:  
   - You will be prompted to enter your **username** and **password**.  
   - If your credentials are incorrect three times, the program will lock for security.  
   - If you enter the correct details, the system will log the **time** of the login and display the **Main Menu**.

3. **Permissions**:  
   - Each user has a set of permissions defined by a bitwise flag.  
   - Depending on your role and the permissions assigned, you will have access to different menu options.  
   - The system checks these permissions before granting access to sensitive features (e.g., transferring funds or managing clients).

4. **Main Menu**:  
   - From the Main Menu, choose from the available options (e.g., view client info, make transactions, manage users, etc.).
   - Each option may have submenus that further define actions for managing clients, transactions, users, etc.

5. **Logout**:  
   - Once you're done, choose the **Logout** option to return to the login screen.
